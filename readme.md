# [resume.trevorsears.com](https://resume.trevorsears.com/)

A resume website for myself, built with React + NextJS, and deployed on Vercel
at [https://resume.trevorsears.com/](https://resume.trevorsears.com/).

## Want to run it locally?

Clone down this repository, install the necessary dependencies, and start the
built-in Next development server:

```
$> git clone git@github.com:T99/resume.trevorsears.com.git
$> cd resume.trevorsears.com
$> npm install
$> npm run dev
```

The development server will start on port 3000 (or the next available/open port)
allowing you to access the local development server at
[http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/). 

## Have more questions, or want to get in contact with me?
